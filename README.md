# VOTERs

“VOTErs” is a solution intended to make every online voting action as secure and empirical as a public election by matching a Bitcoin transaction to a vote cast by a voter in favor of the candidate selected by the voter. 
Our platform therefore makes it possible to take the current process of voting in an election on Election Day (in a state with voter identification  laws) and bring this process fully online, with the aim of making it more easy, safer and even more cost effective for everyone involved.

This project was made using a smart contract in Solidity which facilitates Voting online on Celo in 158 lines of code.
Our contract will be able to create Elections, let people participate in them, and vote for the right candidate.
