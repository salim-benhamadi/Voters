# VOTERs

I made a smart contract in Solidity which facilitates Voting online on Celo in 158 lines of code.
Our contract will be able to create Elections, let people participate in them, and vote for the right candidate. 
## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install the missing nodejs packages

```bash
npm install
```
Use the package manager truffle to compile only the contracts that have been changed since the last compile.
```bash
truffle compile
```
